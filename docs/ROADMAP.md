# slintcn roadmap

## v0.1 — prove "not ugly"

- [x] `Tokens` dark glass theme
- [x] Button (8 variants, 8 sizes)
- [x] Card, Input, Badge
- [x] Showcase app
- [x] CLI `init` + `add`

## v0.1.1 — foundation hardening

Pays down the v0.1 debt that would compound across every overlay
added in v0.2. No new components — every existing surface upgraded
to be Slint-idiomatic, accessible, and dogfood-verified.

- [x] Token system split: `Palette` (raw) + `Tokens` (semantic) for
      cheap future light-theme swap
- [x] Typed enums for variant / size — `variant: "outlin"` typos
      become compile errors instead of silent fallthroughs
- [x] Button refactor: per-variant resolution into rest/hover pairs;
      adding a 9th variant is one row, not six ternary edits
- [x] Keyboard activation (Enter / Space) + visible 2px focus ring
      on Button and Input, driven by `Tokens.color-ring`
- [x] Card hover is self-tracked via internal `TouchArea`
- [x] CLI `rewriteImports` actually rewrites + honors
      `themeDir` / `componentsDir` config (covered by `node:test`)
- [x] Showcase regenerates itself through `slintcn add` on every
      `cargo build` — no more bypass of the user code path
- [x] `make verify` (npm test + cargo build + clippy -D warnings)

## v0.2 — shadcn shell (current)

App-chrome overlays. Slint has no portals, so modals mount as the last
Window child sized to fill via `width: parent.width; height: parent.height`
(documented in popup-helpers.slint).

- [x] **Label** + **Separator** primitives (form scaffolding for the rest)
- [x] **popup-helpers.slint** shared module — `Scrim` (full-coverage
      dimmed backdrop, opacity-animated, click-to-dismiss callback)
- [x] **Dialog** — title + description + `@children` body + default
      Close-button footer; Escape closes; backdrop click closes
      (configurable). Slide-up + fade entrance.
- [x] **AlertDialog** — destructive-confirm variant; Cancel + Action
      footer; no backdrop dismissal; Escape fires `cancelled()`
- [x] **Sheet** — side-anchored drawer (top/right/bottom/left); slide
      animation matches anchor edge; configurable `panel-extent`
- [x] **Tooltip** — hover-triggered floating bubble; wraps trigger as
      `@children`; `side: TooltipSide`
- [x] **Toast** + **Toaster** — Sonner-shaped imperative API
      (`ToastQueue.show(text, variant)`); single-active for v0.2;
      auto-dismiss after 3 s; variants default / success / error
- [x] CLI: transitive component dependencies — `dialog` resolves
      `popup-helpers + button + separator + theme` automatically

### v0.2 limitations (tracked for v0.3)

- **Focus trap** inside Dialog/Sheet is not airtight; Tab can escape
  to the underlying UI. (Slint's FocusScope grabs focus but doesn't
  cycle-bound it.)
- **Tooltip clipping** at window edges — the bubble is in-tree, so
  near-edge triggers can crop. PopupWindow-based positioning would
  fix this but introduces its own constraints.
- **Toast queue** is single-active. Stacked toasts + per-toast
  dismissal timing need richer Slint array mutation than 1.16 ships.

## v0.3 — developer experience

- [ ] Real focus trap inside modal overlays (Tab cycling)
- [ ] PopupWindow-based Tooltip + edge-aware positioning
- [ ] Stacked Toast queue with per-toast lifecycle
- [ ] `slintcn init` scaffolds Rust `build.rs` import paths
- [ ] Font guide (Inter / Geist embedding in Slint)
- [ ] Icon slot pattern (optional `image` prop + lucide PNG pipeline)
- [ ] `npx slintcn@latest` published package
- [ ] Registry index on GitHub (raw URL like shadcn)
- [ ] Visual regression: render showcase frames in CI
- [ ] Second theme: `light` (same components, swapped tokens)

## v1.0 — expand beyond SaaS

- [ ] `registry/game/` — HudPill, SlotTile, KeycapHint
- [ ] `registry/embedded/` — compact density preset
- [ ] Optional codegen from `components.toml` (spine-rs integration)

## Design principles (non-negotiable)

1. **Copy-paste over crate dependency** for primitives
2. **Hover / press / focus** must match web shadcn semantics (pointer cursor, 1px press, no fake 4px bounce)
3. **No runtime backdrop-blur** on Slint until platform supports it — fake glass with scrim + hairline (documented)
4. **Tokens are the only source of color** in components
